# Database-Project

This project was done during the fall semester in 2021-2022.
This database is created in order to make the events planning business a digital one.
This system will help the company to extend not only in the physical place where it is located but in all cities of Albania and even abroad.
 Main actors of this project will be 3: the customer the business and the planner. They will be closely related to each other. Once a new customer enters the system, he will find a bunch of services offered to him such as photo, video, restaurant, deejay and so on. If we find it difficult to choose a business, they will be a number of planners ready to help the customer. The planner will suggest any company for the service that the customer is looking for. Based on the planner suggestion and the advertisement that this company has published in its profile, the customer will be able to decide for the company.
The database will also keep track of the prices paid from customer. So, after some month or years of using this database, the new customers will somehow know the average prices for all companies that are part of our database, based on previous years activity. 
In total there will be 7 entities (main 3 of them are mention above). 
The main goal of this database is to set the planning business a step further.
